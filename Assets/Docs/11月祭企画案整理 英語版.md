# 🎭 Project Overview — November Festival Game Plan

### 🌌 **Concept / Setting**

The player is in a surreal state — like a dream, drug trip, or drunken hallucination.
The game focuses on *distortion*, *illusion*, and *loss of sanity*.

---

## 🎮 **Game Overview**

* **3D third-person game**
* Each stage has different gimmicks and visual effects
* After each stage, the screen gets more distorted ("trippy")
* **3 stages total (tentative)**
* Each stage has a **time limit**
* The player can **run**, but it consumes **stamina**

---

## 🗺️ **Stages**

* Many **fall-type challenges** (like jumping on logs; falling makes you restart)
* **Final stage:**

  * A **monster** chases the player
  * You must find items to **escape**
  * If caught, you’re sent back to the start and **drop your items**

---

## 💎 **Items**

* Found in treasure chests
* Can give either **buffs (positive effects)** or **debuffs (negative effects)**

Examples:
**Buffs:** faster speed, no stamina drain, longer time limit, higher jump
**Debuffs:** slower speed, faster stamina drain

---

## 🧠 **Core Game Concept**

The player experiences increasing *distortion and madness* as they progress.
Visuals and sounds get more unstable, creating a sense of *losing control or sanity*.

---

## ⚙️ **Basic System**

* **Movement:** Walk or run (stamina drains when running)
* **Stamina:** Recovers over time
* **Time Limit:** Each stage has one; running out = failure
* **Visual effects:** Screen warping, color shifts, blur, shaking
* **Illusions:** Some platforms are fake or invisible

---

## 🧱 **Stage Breakdown**

### Stage 1 — Tutorial

Simple jumping and falling mechanics, mild screen distortion.

### Stage 2 — Harder

More traps, moving platforms, and time pressure.

### Stage 3 — Chase and Escape

A monster hunts you. You must collect items to open the exit.
If caught → restart and lose items.

---

## 🔊 **Audio & Visual Design**

* Visual effects: shaking, blur, wave distortion, dark tone
* Sounds: echoing footsteps, whispers, laughter (hallucinations), intense BGM
* UI: becomes more warped and blurry as the game progresses

---

## ✨ **Special Features**

* **Optical illusions:** fake platforms, invisible ones appearing/disappearing
* **Fake enemies:** appear for 3 seconds and vanish

## 🕹️ **Controls**

| Action            | Key              |
| ----------------- | ---------------- |
| Move              | WASD             |
| Run               | Shift            |
| Jump              | Space            |

| Use / Switch Item | E / Scroll Wheel |
| Pause             | Esc              |

---

## 🎥 **Camera & Feel**

* Slight camera lag to create motion sickness / dreamlike movement
* Flash screen white when falling for “losing consciousness” effect

---

## 👨‍💻 **Programmer Task Overview**

Everything needed for implementation is listed in detail, including:

### Player System

* Movement, jump physics, camera control, stamina system

### Status & Mechanics

* Buff/debuff logic, sanity meter, time limit system

### Gimmicks

* Platforms that move, vanish, or reappear
* Respawn system for falls
* Random treasure chest rewards

### Enemy AI (Stage 3)

* Detect and chase player
* Reset after catching player + drop items
* Occasionally spawn fake illusionary enemies

### Visual / Audio Effects

* Screen distortion, blur, noise, color shift
* Footstep echo, ambient hallucination sounds, dynamic BGM

### Timer System

* Countdown timer
* Red blinking warning at 10 seconds

### Item System

* Buffs/debuffs with time-based effects
* Stage-specific items
* Colored visual effect when activated (blue for buff, red for debuff)

### Stage Time Limits

| Stage | Time | Features                          |
| ----- | ---- | --------------------------------- |
| 1     | 180s | Log jumps, falling traps          |
| 2     | 150s | Moving/disappearing platforms     |
| 3     | 240s | Monster chase + item-based escape |

## 🔚 **Overall Goal**

Create a **surreal, trippy 3D game** where visuals, sound, and gameplay gradually make the player feel **disoriented** — as if they’re **losing their mind** inside the dream world.
